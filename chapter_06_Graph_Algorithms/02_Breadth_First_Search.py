"""
Breadth-First Search takes a different approach from Depth-First Search when
searching a graph. Breadth-First Search systematically visits all vertices in the
graph G = (V, E) that are k edges away from the source vertex s before visiting any
vertex that is k + 1 edges away. This process repeats until no more vertices are
reachable from s. Breadth-First Search does not visit vertices in G that are not
reachable from s. The algorithm works for undirected as well as directed graphs.
Breadth-First Search is guaranteed to find the shortest path in the graph from ver‚Äê
tex s to a desired target vertex, although it may evaluate a rather large number of
nodes as it operates. Depth-First Search tries to make as much progress as possible,
and may locate a path more quickly, which may not be the shortest path.
